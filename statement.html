        <h1> Unfairness </h1>
        <p>This website is a take on the HTML narrative. Constructed in form of a "blog" about neglection of
            employees in their workspace. It's not always obvious but in many cases, employees tend to be
            mistreated. Things like favoritism, manipulation, gaslighting, ignorance, selfishness, etc are used by
            the higher power to downgrade a work's worth. More often, people including part-time students, minimum
            wage workers, tip based salary workers, or even permanent employees that have been working in the same
            spot for a long time.
        </p>
        <p>It's meant to be presented as a joke/ irony / simulation of fake scenarios that have been based on real
            life events.
            Although the texts are somewhat of an exageration, those are common issues that could or probably had
            already happened to each and every one of us. It's a topic meant to feel relatable.
        </p>

            <h1>Essay</h1>
            <p>You have to respect your employees. Not only does everyone deserve proper treatment regarding their
                ethnicity, gender and personality, but also a proper compensation when an employee shows potential, hard
                work and loyalty providing benefits to their workspace. Despite employees' rights, some employers and
                higher ups find gray zones/ loopholes that allow them to lower someone’s worth without getting in
                trouble with the law. Using manipulation, gas lighting, threats and guilt tripping actions into loyalty
                of their workers. And not everyone can afford losing their position as it’s their only source of income.
                Some examples can be seen with waiters/waitresses, retail stores, minimum-wage workers, part-time
                students, intern stages, newly employed, or even those who had been working in the same environment for
                a long period of time. Compensations aren’t always luxury. Some might think that giving someone a 50$
                gift card to use in their workspace is a good gift while this money will eventually just go back to the
                company, and not benefit the employee. </p>

               <p> Despite trying hard since summer 2021, companies are struggling to bring back frontline workers. This
                has led to problems like not being able to deliver products, losing money, and upsetting customers.
                Supply chains are still messed up because there aren't enough people working in warehouses and delivery.
                Stores and pharmacies can't keep their shelves full. Restaurants, hotels, and airlines are all short on
                staff too. As a reaction, they tried typical quick solutions like increasing hourly wages, giving
                signing and referral bonuses, and being more flexible with shifts. However, these measures didn't work
                well. As the labor situation got worse in 2022, some companies started using tactics that went against
                their main strategies.(1) Changes in labor policies can stir controversy and may involve those gray
                areas concerning worker rights, job security, wage laws, and regulations related to labor unions.
                Certain reforms might simplify the process for employers to hire or dismiss workers, raising worries
                about job security and potential unfair treatment. Changes to minimum wage laws can unintentionally
                result in consequences like job reduction or employers to hire workers off the records. (3) </p>    

               <p> “You are entitled to and shall be granted a rest period of at least 8 consecutive hours between work
                periods or shifts.” This rule is often overlooked. A lot of people work less than what is granted
                voluntarily, yet in other situations (for example: the company is short staffed), employers might add an
                extra shift to people that are available to “help” out without a proper warning. This kind of management
                is unprofessional and lacks proper communication. On another note, concerning employees working on a tip
                based salary, colleagues can choose to combine tips. One can also opt to share them with other employees
                in the workplace. However, the employer cannot force an employee to share tips with others or set up a
                voluntary tipping pool. If a tip-sharing plan is established, it must be mutually agreed upon by all
                workers involved. Yet sometimes, employers do find a way to turn that option into a rule without making
                it feel wrong. (2) </p>

                <p>The Quebec Labor Code is a provincial law that allows employees to join unions and establishes the rules
                governing the employment relationship between employers and unionized employees. A collective bargaining
                agreement that establishes labor standards for the members of a company or organization. The federal
                equivalent of these regulations is the Canada Labor Act (2). However, there are a few downsides. One of
                them being the fact that unions arent free. Union dues can cost workers a lot of money each year,
                ranging from $200 to several hundred dollars. Not all workers in a union have to pay these dues, though.
                Those who do are essentially giving up a portion of their pay to be part of the union, which can be
                around 2.5% of their salary for some unions. On top of that, there are other fees like yearly fees,
                initiation fees, and more that can add up over time. Additionally, Unions sometimes make workers and
                companies feel like enemies because they focus only on workers' rights instead of working together.
                Then, political activities, like talking to the government, but not all workers agree with their
                decisions, which can cause problems. (4)</p>
